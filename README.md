# Space-women
At the end of a 6 weeks formation at Simplon in Paris, I was asked to produce a simple web site.

I chose to talk about women who took an important part in space exploration, such as the Rocket Girls of Nasa, Dorothy Vaughan, Margaret Hamilton, Frances Northcuttand Bonnie Dunbar. Of course this list is not exhaustive and many more women deserve to be knonw. 

# First steps
First, I designed a wireframe (UX) and then a UI representation, using Figma.
