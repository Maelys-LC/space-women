# About this project
At the end of a 6 weeks training period on HTML and CSS at Simplon in Paris, I was asked to produce a simple website.

I chose to talk about women who had an important part in space exploration, such as the Rocket Girls of Nasa, Dorothy Vaughan, Margaret Hamilton, Frances Northcutt and Bonnie Dunbar. Of course this list is not exhaustive and many more women deserve to be better known. 

# Languages and tools 
HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Visual Studio Code, Figma, Coolors, Netlify

# UX - UI
I designed an UX wireframe and then an UI representation, using https://www.figma.com
I picked vintage and harmonious colours using https://coolors.co/

# The web site
I mostly used HTML and CSS, although I enjoyed using JS for the scroll effect of the title section and the burger menu.
